        Why fire doors?
      </h2>

      <p class="text-gray-500 mt-4 md:mt-4 md:block">
        Buildings are compartmented to delay the spread of fire and smoke from
        one area to another. The compartments are usually linked by doors to
        allow for passage of traffic.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-500 mt-4 md:mt-4 md:block">
        Fire door sets have important functions in a fire, when closed they form
        a barrier to fire and smoke spread, they also provide a means of escape.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-500 mt-4 md:mt-4 md:block">
        Most fire deaths are not caused by burns, but by smoke inhalation, which
        can lead to the inability to exit the building. <span
